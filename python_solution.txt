step1: sort all files using external sort using id then date

step2: open all files in parallel

step3:
    - read line by line [only 1 line is read in memory from each file]
    - get min id from 1st line of all files -> current_id, file_name
    - for each other file if next line has same id as current_id get next value
    - write value with latest date into result file

repeat step 3 until reached end of all files
